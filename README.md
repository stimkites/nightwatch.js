-   To duplicate line in editor, use CTRL + D
-   Use Esc key to exit from fullscreen mode and stop test immediately

-   Every test is automatically saved under your user name in specified .js type

-   If everything is completely frozen - stop the Selenium server and run it again
-   Before deleting any tests, please, make sure it's yours or you are allowed to do it.
